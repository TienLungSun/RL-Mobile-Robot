This repository contains the deep reinforcement learning (RL) materials we used to train an intelligent mobile robot to reach goal while avoiding obstacles. The training environment is created using Unity and ML Agent. The deep learning NN is implemented using PyTorch.
The folder "Learn PPO(AC)" contains PyTorch implementation of PPO(AC) algorithm that interacts with ML Agent.
The folder "Reach goal without obstacles" contains Unity scene and ML Agent configuration file to train the mobile robot to reach goal in an environment without obstacles.
Here are videos of nice training results:	https://youtu.be/1wCCglrMkqc
