  We train a mobile robot to reach goal using the relative angle only s=(theta, d1~dn), NO MORE relative distance information (DeltaX, DeltaY). 
The Unity package (v. 2020.1.17f1), the training configuration file (ML Agent Release 10), and instructions ppt are included. Please see ppt for instructions.
