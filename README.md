We train a mobile robot to reach goal using the relative angle only s=(theta, d1~dn), not using relative distance information any more (DeltaX, DeltaY). 
The Unity package (v. 2020.1.17f1), the training configuration file (ML Agent Release 10), and instructions ppt are included. Please see ppt for instructions.
