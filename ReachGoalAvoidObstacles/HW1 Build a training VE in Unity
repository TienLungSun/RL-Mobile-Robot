1. Unity hub -> log in
2. Activate a new authorization -> personal version
3. You need to have a least one Unity installization
4. Project -> create a new Unity project -> 3D

5. Layout button (upper right)-> 2x3
   project window -> one column layout

6. Hierarchy window-> 3d object -> cube, cylinder, plane

7. Camera manipulations in your Scene window
Roll your middle mouse -> zoom in/out
alt+press your left mouse -> rotate camera
Press and hold your middle mouse -> pan your scene window camera

8. Object move/rotate/zoom
select the object in the Hierarchy window
click the move/roate/scale button (upper left) 
move/roate/scale along X,Y,Z axis (RGB)
If you want to move/roate/scale along X,Y,Z axes simutaneously, select the cube at origin

9. Material 
Project window -> R click-> Create-> material
select the color you want
drag the material ball to the object

10. Place objects
better use top/side/front view
change between perspective proj. and orthographic proj.

11. Parent/child relationship in the Hierarchy window
put the cylinder as the child of the car

12. Trick to visualize an object
select any object in the Hierarchy window, double click the object to automatically place this object in the middle of your scene window


HW1: 3D virtual environment to train AI to navigate, i.e., reach goal while avoiding obstacles
due 3/11, hard copy


HW1 due today

1. Add distance sensors to the car
Create an empty object -> rename "dist sensor"
Place the distance sensor at the center of the car (z-axis faces forward direction) (xyz RGB)
Make the dist sensor the child object of the car
Copy-paste (rotate along y, 20, 40, ...) (NOTICE: Switch to local coordinate)

2. Add "Rigidbody" component to the car so it can detect collision
mass = 100 or larger
Use gravity
Freeze rotation along x, y (only allow to rotate along y)

3. Adjust the main camera for game window appearance
Rotate along x 90
projection -> orthographic, suitable size (6.06)

4. Adjust directional light

5. Adjust box collider of the car to cover the head 

6. Add "goal" tag to the goal object

7. Group together to form a training VE
Create an empty object -> rename "training VE"
Put car, walls, goal, obstacle as the child objects of training VE

======= finish Unity VE construction
