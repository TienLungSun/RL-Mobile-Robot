1. Install Anaconda on your computer to run python code 
https://github.com/TienLungSun/AI-Lecture-notes
Make sure your User directory does not have Chinese.
If you want to delete your old Anaconda installation, manually delete the anaconda3 and all .* folders in the User folder where you have your old Anaconda installed. Reboot your computer.

2. Install Unity ML-Agent
https://github.com/TienLungSun/RL-Mobile-Robot

3. Import ML Agent package to your Unity project
Open Package Manager Window
Select "Add package from disk"
Select ML agent folder/com.unity.ml-agents/package.json

4. Summary - 3 softwares
1) Unity Hub, Unity
2) Anaconda
3) ML Agents 

5. Take a look at ML Agent folder
com.unity.ml-agents\package.json ==> import ML Agent package to Unity project
ml-agents\setup.py ==> install ML Agent to Anaconda
config\ppo\*.yaml ==> define the hyper-parameters for RL training
ml-agents\mlagents\trainers\ppo\trainer.py ==> implement the PPO algorithm

6. Create a ML agent to control your car
Empty object -> rename 'CarAgent'
Place CarAgent as the child of the car
Add "Decision Requester" component

6. Behavior Parameters
For this agent, we will use vector to reprent the stae s = (stage, facing angle, d1 to d18 from range sensor)
stage 1~3 stage 1(1, 0, 0), stage2 (0, 1, 0), stage3 (0, 0, 1)
A total of 3+1+18 = 22 values to represent state s
2 continuous actions: move forward/backward and turn left/right

7. Agent script
