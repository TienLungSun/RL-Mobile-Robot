The robot only knows the direction of the goal and the range sensor distance. The relative distance between the agent and the goal (deltaX, deltaY) is not given. As such, the NN trained can be deployed to a real elderly-care robot implemented using Jetbot which uses camera and computer vision to determine the direction of the elderly.
