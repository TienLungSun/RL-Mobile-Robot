This repository contains the materials (Unity training VE and configuration file) we used to train an intelligent mobile robot to reach goal while avoiding obstacles, using the RL algorithm PPO from MLAgent. 
The robot only knows the direction of the goal and the range sensor distance. The relative distance between the agent and the goal (deltaX, deltaY) is not given. 
As such, the NN trained can be deployed to a real robot implemented using Jetbot which uses camera and computer vision to determine the direction of the elderly.
